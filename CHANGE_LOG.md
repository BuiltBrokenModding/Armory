# INFO
This log contains changes made to the project. Each entry contains changed made after the last version but before the number was changed. Any changes made after a number change are considered part of the next release. This is regardless if versions are still being released with that version number attached. 

If this is a problem, use exact build numbers to track changes. As each build logs the git-hash it was created from to better understand changes made.

It is also important to note these changes are for several repos. As this repository is primarily used for the core segement of the project. Other projects are merged in at build time to create the complete project.
